# Motivation
- Ores usually contain impurities such as silicates, removing the impurities is considered a fundamental step during mining process.
- This is done using Froth Flotation
- Impurity concentration is measured at 2 hour intervals
- Goal: predict silica % using available readings
- Accurate prediction gives operators information in advance, so they could alter operating conditions to achieve more favorable results.
